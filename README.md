# RiddleWordle
A game inspired by Wordle. A riddle is shown and the user has to guess what the answer to the riddle is. 

The user will have a total of 5 attempts to solve each riddle. If all 5 attempts are used, the answer will be shown on the screen and the user will be prompted to move on to the 
next question. 

This program uses local storage, similar to the actual Wordle, so all the progress made by the user is saved.
